# Manufacturing Anomaly Tracking System
A Manufacturing Anomaly Tracking System using Google Forms and Excel Dashboard with Pareto analysis for prioritization, conducting root cause analyses, and implementing actions using the 5W2H.

##  STAR Summary
Situation: The manufacturing process lacked a structured method to record, monitor, and prioritize anomalies, making it difficult to address recurring issues effectively.

Task: Create a system to capture production anomalies, prioritize them, and ensure corrective actions were systematically tracked and implemented.

Action: Designed a Production Anomaly Tracking System combining Google Forms for data entry and an Excel dashboard with Pareto analysis to highlight priority issues. Led root cause analyses and action planning using the 5W2H methodology.

Result: Established a structured, data-driven anomaly management process, enabling prioritization of issues, systematic root cause elimination, and improved production reliability, cutting 18% of anomalies.
